This project is a signal sampling studio based on nyquist rate.
A GUI was built to view a signal whether it's a medical signal or not.

In the main window there's a place for a channel to view a signal based on the user's choice and there's an option to view or hide the nyquist rate of this signal whether it's 1f, 2f, or 3f according to the 
slider value that the user chooses.

Also there's a second window that pops up whe the user chooses the composer option and it enables the user to construct a signal by choosing frequency, magnitude, and phase of this signal and then view it in the 
channel next to it.

There's an option if the user wants to sum multiple signals and view the result on a channelbelow the composer channel.
The following photos illustrate more about the GUI and its results.

1- the following photo shows the main window and the channel with the signal after choosing it.

2- The following photo shows the nyquist rate of triple the frequency of the original signal

3-The following photo shows the composer window that pops up when the user chooses composer from the main window

4-the following photo shows the signal that the user generated based on the values the user entered.

5-The following photo shows other signal generated by the user

6- The following photo shows that if the user chooses the option added to summation as shown with every signal, then the user will be apple to view the composition by choosing compose as shown

7- Also there's an option to add the composition graph on the main graph to see the difference.
